QT seems to want build information separate from the main project.
So here is an example of how you can make your own build folder....

I didn't include the output from the qmake but it was happy and created everything  needed including the executiable.

$ cd
$ cd /tmp
$ mkdir poo
$ cd poo
$ qmake-qt5 $HOME/QT/PubStor/PubStor.pro
$ ls
Makefile
$ make

.
.
.
