A QT Use the postgresql database to manipulate a book shelf.

I got this initially from:

https://apparatusd.wordpress.com/2010/09/08/simple-qt4-and-postgresql-book-catalog-application/

The spent time fixing what seemed to be not working.
Probably because my versions are much newer than the oneused on the web page.

Existing Issues not limited to:

o	the search window only works once. 
	I think I need to add an additional trigger.

o	I think the add window also only works once.  needs more work
	

Comments welcome
