A QT project with the postgresql database to manipulate a book shelf.

I got this initially from:

https://apparatusd.wordpress.com/2010/09/08/simple-qt4-and-postgresql-book-catalog-application/
I sent a comment about some of the problems I found.


Then spent time fixing what seemed to be not working.
Probably because my versions are much newer than the one used on the web page.


Latest updates:

	Added a settings tab to eventually load and save a config file.
	Added ability to seup and save the users own data base connection particulars.



Existing Issues not limited to:

?

Todo:

	Add support for MySql and SQLite


Fixed:



Help and Comments welcome
