A QT project with the postgresql database to manipulate a book shelf.

I got this initially from:

https://apparatusd.wordpress.com/2010/09/08/simple-qt4-and-postgresql-book-catalog-application/

Then spent time fixing what seemed to be not working.
Probably because my versions are much newer than the one used on the web page.

Existing Issues not limited to:

o	the search window only works once. 
	I think I need to add an additional trigger.

o	I think the add window also only works once.  needs more work
	
Todo:
o	Add ability to seup and save the users own data base connection



Help and Comments welcome
